Cra
Developed by HoundDeepmind.Inc, is an AI-powered web development agent that allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser—no local setup required. If you're here to build your own AI-powered web dev agent using the Cra codebase, click here to get started!

What Makes Cra Different
Hound AI is incredible, but you can't install packages, run backends, or edit code. That’s where Cra stands out:

Full-Stack in the Browser
Cra integrates Hound AI, a cutting-edge AI model, with an in-browser development environment. This allows you to:

Install and run npm tools and libraries (like Vite, Next.js, and more)

Run Node.jsservers

Interact with third-party APIs

Deploy to production from chat

Share your work via a URL

AI with Environment Control
Unlike traditional dev environments where the AI can only assist in code generation, Cra gives Hound AI complete control over the entire environment, including the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console. This empowers AI agents to handle the entire app lifecycle—from creation to deployment.

Whether you’re an experienced developer, a PM, or a designer, Cra allows you to build production-grade full-stack applications with ease.

Tips and Tricks
Here are some tips to get the most out of Cra:

Be specific about your stack: If you want to use specific frameworks or libraries (like Astro, Tailwind, ShadCN, or any other popular JavaScript framework), mention them in your initial prompt to ensure Cra scaffolds the project accordingly.

Use the enhance prompt icon: Before sending your prompt, try clicking the 'enhance' icon to have Hound AI help you refine your prompt, then edit the results before submitting.

Scaffold the basics first, then add features: Make sure the basic structure of your application is in place before diving into more advanced functionality. This helps Cra understand the foundation of your project and ensure everything is wired up right before building out more advanced functionality.

Batch simple instructions: Save time by combining simple instructions into one message. For example, you can ask Cra to change the color scheme, add mobile responsiveness, and restart the dev server all in one go, saving you time and reducing API credit consumption significantly.
